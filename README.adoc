= LRA Trip example

== Building and running

This example consists of 4 application microservices and an LRA coordinator.

The LRA coordinator can run as a docker container:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm --name lra-coordinator --network host quay.io/jbosstm/lra-coordinator
----

The `host` network is required since coordinator call the individual services.

Then you can run all provided services with `./mvnw quarkus:dev` in their individual directories:

- `trip-service`
- `airline-service`
- `hotel-service`
- `car-service`
